#### *VastDB* **case example: Identification and characterization of conserved** ***Srrm4*** **targets in mammals**

This document is a companion of the publication *Computational analysis of alternative splicing using vast-tools and the VastDB framework* and leads the reader through the code example of Section 6: **The identification of microexons as the main targets of the splicing factor *Srrm4***.
